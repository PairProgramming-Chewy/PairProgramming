Version control is really important for a few reasons. First, it helps people work together on the same project without messing up each other's work because it keeps track of all changes and who made them. Second, it acts like a safety net because you can go back to an earlier version if something breaks, and you can try out new ideas in separate branches without affecting the main project. Third, it works well with tools that automatically test and deploy your code, making sure everything works smoothly and that the code is reviewed and kept to a high standard.
